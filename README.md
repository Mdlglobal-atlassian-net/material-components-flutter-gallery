# DEPRECATED

This repository is now deprecated and only used for issue tracking of the
Flutter Gallery. Please visit [flutter/samples](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/master/gallery/)
for the current source.

# Flutter Gallery

Flutter Gallery is a resource to help developers evaluate and use Flutter.
It is a collection of material design widgets, behaviors, and vignettes
implemented with Flutter. We often get asked how one can see Flutter in
action, and this gallery helps them see what Flutter provides and how it
behaves in the wild.
